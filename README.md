# hello-world

I am currently a Masters student at Concordia University, set to begin my PhD at Maryland this Fall 2016. 

My research focuses on inverse-marking in Nishnaabemwin (Algonquian), but I am interested in inverse-marking cross-linguistically, as well as agreement systems more broadly.

My newest brainworm is obviation.
